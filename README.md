# A. Introduction<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>
In multi-brand companies, there is often need to have **multiple brand experiences for all applications** . A different theme is required for each brand. For Example: A blue theme for Blue Brand and a green theme for Green Brand. Dynamic branding is ideal for multi-brand companies. You can create a single login page that determines which brand appears at run time. All brands are served from the same login page and integrated with single Identity Provider.

When you are designing the authentication experience for brand applications in your organization, you have to choose whether the user authentication flow will use **Universal/Central (More secured way of user authentication)** or **Application specific Embedded Login page (Less secured way of user authentication)**. Universal Login page provided by Identity provider is always a more secured way of user authentication. In case of a Universal Login page, when the users try to log in they are redirected to a central Login page hosted by Identity Provider, through which authentication is performed, and then they are redirected back to the protected application (e.g. Google Apps or Microsoft Office365 Apps). Each custom sign-in page is hosted on a custom domain URL e.g. login.<brand>.com.

In our scenario, **Franchise Org Corporation** has a single user base to handle its two brands (could be "n" brands), **Blue brand** and **Green brand**. The corporation uses dynamic branding to customize the applications (including login experience) for each brand. When users click login link on each protected application, he/she will be presented with a login page based on the brand indicated in the login URL (dynamic branding). Login page is hosted on central location. User is authenticated against a single Identity Provider and redirected back to protected brand application after user authentication. Sign-in and Sign-out experiences are implemented via standardized sign-in protocols.

If you are designing a solution for a multi-brand company then the solution provided in this GitHub repository is applicable to you. This solution applies if you have selected **Okta as an Identity Management System (Identity Provider)** for your organization.
 
## Summary of Requirements:
Here is summary of requirements for a multi-brand company login page:

1. Universal Login page hosted at central location (not provided by each application)
2. Multiple Brand Experiences with a Single Okta Org. Each brand could have different style for Login page e.g. Green Brand style and Blue Brand style.
3. Applications interact with Identity Management System through Standardized Sign-In Protocols such as OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0 and SAML 2.0
4. Single Sign On (SSO)  is required between protected brand applications.

## Authentication Experiences/Solutions Provided by Okta:
### Solution 1. Customize Okta's Universal Login page for your Org
* Issues with this solution: 
	* Currently, there are limited customization options available for default Okta login page i.e. <a href="#">https://orgdomain.okta.com/login/default</a>  
	* Cannot have multiple brand login experiences for application. This solution is not applicable to your organization if you want have multiple brand experiences for a single Okta Org. 
	
### Solution 2. Each application creates its own Login page using <a href="https://developer.okta.com/code/javascript/okta_sign-in_widget" target="_blank">Okta Sign-In Widget</a>.
* Issues with this solution: 
	* Embedded application login page is always less secure
	* Does not follow standardized Sign-In protocols such as OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0 and SAML 2.0
	* Each application will have to create its own login page (more work and less consistent)
	* Application developeres can easily access/store user's credentials from javascript widget (less secure) 
### Solution 3. Each application creates its own Login page via <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/authn" target="_blank">Okta's Authentication API</a>
* Issues with this solution: 
	* Embedded login page is always less secured way of user authentication
	* Does not follow standardized Sign-In protocols such as OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0 and SAML 2.0
	* Each application will have to create its own login page (more work and less consistent)
	* Each application will have to create other related flows using Okta Authentication API e.g. Reset Password, Forgot Password, etc.
	* Application developeres can easily access/store user's credentials from Login page (less secure)
	* Single Sign-on is not possible for brand applications. 

## Features of Multiple Brand Login Page Solution Provided in this Repository
1. **Multiple Branded Login Experiences with a Single Okta Org**: Login page supports multiple brands for a single okta org. For Example: Green brand and Blue brand.
2. **Dynamic Branding for Multiple Brands**: Dynamic branding is very useful for multi-brand companies. You can create a single login page that determines which brand appears at run time. All brands are served from the same login page that uses single Okta org. We will create separate style sheet for each brand e.g. Blue Style and Green Style
3. **Customizable Login Page**: Fully customizable Login page. For each brand, you can customize based on brand theme using brand style sheet and by using Okta Sign-In widget.  
4. **Responsive Login Page Design**: Login Page is also built with “Responsive Design”, so Login Page renders well on a variety of devices and screen sizes. Responsive design allows Login page to adapt to the device users are viewing it on.
5. **Applications interface with Login Page using Standardized Sign-In Protocols**: Login Page work with the following standardized Sign In protocols: OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0 and SAML 2.0. By using standardized sign in protocols Applications are loosely coupled with the Identity Management System. Standard Sign-In protocols also issue security tokens (JWT and SAML2.0) that allow the application to call protected APIs. REST APIs are protected with OAuth2.0 and require JWT tokens to be passed.
6. **Single Sign-On**: Applications issue “passive” authentication requests to the Login Page/Identity Management System using URL redirection (HTTP 302). After authentication by the user a session cookie is set in the user’s browser cookie cache. This enables one of the most important features of the Identity Management System, the ability of the user to “Single Sign-On” between different applications in the same Identity Realm. Users only need to enter their credentials once when moving from one application to another.
7. **Universal Login Page (more secured)** – Multiple Brand Universal Login Page is hosted on central location to keep your attack surface as small as possible and minimize the risk to the users and applications in the Identity Realm. Developers who create the Login Page are trained and specialize in a particular Identity Management System and are trusted. Application developers who either by malicious intent or ignorance of the identity management system do not have that ability, they put user identities/credentials and the applications/data at risk.
8. **Simpler Maintainability**: Universal Login page is easy to maintain. Login Page is built using **Okta Sign-In widget** and contains all features provided by Okta e.g. Forgot Password, Unlock Account, Help, **Multi-Factor Authentication**. If new features are added by the Identity Management System provider then they are immediately incorporated and available in the Login Page. 
9. **Provides a consistent user experience for each brand**: Multi-brand Login Page always appears exactly the same and at the same URL regardless of the application the user is authenticating for each brand. User always knows which set of credentials to enter because it’s the same Brand Login Page.

# B. Prerequisites<a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a>

Before you get started, you'll need to install or set up the
software and services below:

1.  Download and install [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)     
    At this time, Visual Studio 2017 is the most recent version of Visual Studio available.

    <img src="Documentation/Images/vs-community.png" alt="Visual Studion Community"/>
	<br/>

2.  Sign up for [Okta Developer Edition](http://developer.okta.com/).    
    You'll need an Okta *organization* of your own to use as you follow this guide. After activating your account, log in to it. If you just created an account, you'll see a screen similar to the one below. Click on **< > Developer Console** in the top-left corner and switch to the Classic UI.
    
    <img src="Documentation/Images/okta-classic-ui.png" alt="Okta Dev Console" width="800"/> 
	<br/>

3.  *Optional:* Sign up for a [free trial of Microsoft Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/).
    
    This step is not required. You can run sample applications from your computer. However, if you want to host Branded Login pages and Web applications on a public-facing Website then Azure is the easiest place to do that. You can map custom Domain Names to Azure Web application. This will be useful for hosting multi-branded login page application.

# D. Setting up Okta's Preview Sandbox<a id="sec-4" name="sec-4"></a>

1. Create a Custom Authorization Server
2. Create Identity Providers for Each Branded Login Page
3. Enabling CORS (Trusted Origins)
4. Create Test User Accounts for Each Brand (Add Person)
5. Create Groups
6. Add OpenID Connect and SAML 2.0 Applications

## Step 1. Create a Custom Authorization Server ##

Okta allows you to create custom OAuth 2.0 authorization servers. Create a new custom authorization server for this application.

1. Go to **Security → API → Authorization Servers**
2. Click on **"Add authorization server"** button

	<img src="Documentation/Images/AuthServer-001.png" alt="Add Authorization Server" />

3.  Provide below information and click on Save button.

	* Name: Franchisor Org Auth
	* Audience: https://franchisor.org.com
	* Description: Authorization server for franchisor 

4.  It will add a custom authorization server.

	<img src="Documentation/Images/AuthServer-002.png" alt="Add Authorization Server" />

5.  Access Policies:

	By default, there is no access policies. We will add access policies for our sample application later.

## Step 2. Create Identity Providers for Each Branded Login Page ##
Okta allows you to create Identity Providers to manage federations with external Identity Providers (IdP). Each identity provider (IdP) requires some setup. For this application, we will create an Identity Provider for each branded login page.

1. Go to **Security → API → Identity Providers**
	<img src="Documentation/Images/IdP-001.png" alt="Add Identity Provider"/>

### 2.1	Create Identity Provider for "Green Brand Login Page" ###
This is for Green Brand. This will not be act as a true identity provider. This will not do traditional SAML 2.0 Request/Response (as SAML2 functionaliy is never used). Its only job is to route the authentication request to the branded login page, which contains the Sign-in widget. 
 
1. Click on **"Add Identity Provider"** button
2. Select “Add SAML 2.0 IdP”
	<br/>
	<img src="Documentation/Images/IdP-002A.png" alt="Add Identity Provider"/>
	<br/><br/>
3. Provide fields for new Identity Provider
	* Name: Green Brand Login Page
	* IdP Username: idpuser.subjectNameId
	* Filter: Unchecked
	* Match against: Okta Username
	* If No match is found: Redirect to Okta Sign-in Page
	* SAML Protocol Settings:
	* IdP Issuer URI: Provide URL for Green branded Login Page. 
		For Example: https://demo.login.greenbrand.com
	* **IdP Single Sign-on URI: Provide URL for Green brand Login Page URL**.
		This is the URL where login page application is hosted. Unauthenticated user will be redirected there. 
		For Example: https://demo.login.greenbrand.com
	* Request Binding: HTTP POST
	* Request Signature: Unchecked
	* Rest of the fields : Default Values
	<img src="Documentation/Images/IdP-003.png" alt="Add Identity Provider"/>
	<br/>
	<img src="Documentation/Images/IdP-004.png" alt="Add Identity Provider"/>
	<br/>
4.  It will create a new SAML 2.0 Identity Provider
	<br/>
	<img src="Documentation/Images/IdP-005A.png" alt="Add Identity Provider"/>
	<br/>
	* Note: The last highlighted part of Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL provides **idp** value. This value be will be sent as **idp** query string parameter value in the authentication request to route to the green branded login page.

### 2.2	Create Identity Provider for "Blue Brand Login Page" ###
This is for Blue Brand. This will not be acted as true identity provider. This will not do traditional SAML 2.0 Request/Response (as SAML2 functionaliy is never used). Its only job to host login page, which contains the sign-in widget. 

1. Click on **"Add Identity Provider"** button
2. Select “Add SAML 2.0 IdP”
	<img src="Documentation/Images/IdP-002A.png" alt="Add Identity Provider"/>
3. Provide fields for new Identity Provider
	* Name: Blue Brand Login Page
	* IdP Username: idpuser.subjectNameId
	* Filter: Unchecked
	* Match against: Okta Username
	* If No match is found: Redirect to Okta Sign-in Page
	* SAML Protocol Settings:
	* IdP Issuer URI: Provide URL for Blue branded Login Page.
		For Example: https://demo.login.bluebrand.com
	* **IdP Single Sign-on URI: Provide URL for Blue brand Login Page URL.** 
		This is the URL where login page application is hosted. Unauthenticated user will be redirected there. 
		For Example: https://demo.login.bluebrand.com
	* Request Binding: HTTP POST
	* Request Signature: Unchecked
	* Rest of the fields : Default Values
	<br/><br/>
	<img src="Documentation/Images/IdP-006.png" alt="Add Identity Provider"/>
	<br/>
	<img src="Documentation/Images/IdP-007.png" alt="Add Identity Provider"/>
	<br/>
4. It will create a new SAML 2.0 Identity Provider
	<br/>
	<img src="Documentation/Images/IdP-008.png" alt="Add Identity Provider"/>
	<br/>
	* Note: The last highlighted part of Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL provides **idp** value. This value be will be sent as **idp** query string parameter value in the authentication request to route to the blue branded login page.

## Step 3. Enabling CORS (Trusted Origins) ##
In Okta, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) allows JavaScript hosted on your websites to make an XHR to the Okta API with the Okta session cookie. Every website origin must be explicitly permitted via the administrator UI for CORS. You have to enable CORS for the Branded Login pages.

**Go to Security → API → Trusted Origins**

### 3.1 Add CORS for Green Brand Login Page ###
- Click on **Add Origin**
	* Name: Green Brand Login
	* Origin URL: Provide Branded Login Page URL e.g. https://demo.login.greenbrand.com
	* Type: CORS [Checked] Redirect [Unchecked]
- Click on **Save** button
	<br/>
	<img src="Documentation/Images/Cors-001A.png" alt="Add CORS"/>
	<br/>
### 3.2 Add CORS for Blue Brand Login Page ###
- Click on **Add Origin**
	* Name: Blue Brand Login
	* Origin URL: Provide Branded Login Page URL e.g. https://demo.login.bluebrand.com
	* Type: CORS [Checked] Redirect [Unchecked]
- Click on **Save** button
	<br/>
	<img src="Documentation/Images/Cors-002A.png" alt="Add CORS"/>
	<br/>
- Now, you should have **two CORS** in the list of Origins
	<br/>
	<img src="Documentation/Images/Cors-003A.png" alt="Add CORS"/>
	<br/>	

## Step 4. Create Test User Accounts for Each Brand (Add Person) ##
Now, we will add two test accounts in Okta. Use the People page to add test users.

Go to **Directory → People**

### 4.1 Add Test User Account for Green Brand ###
Enter a test user account for Green Brand. For Example: John.Doe@greenbrand.com

- Click on **Add Person**
	* First Name: John
	* Last Name: Doe
	* Username: John.Doe@greenbrand.com
	* Primary Email: John.Doe@greenbrand.com
	* Password: set by admin
	* Password: provide value
	* [Unchecked] User must change password on first login 
	<br/>
	<img src="Documentation/Images/Person-001.png" alt="Add Person"/>
	<br/>

### 4.2 Add Test User Account for Blue Brand ###
Enter a test user account for Green Brand. For Example: Jane.Doe@bluebrand.com

- Click on **Add Person**
	* First Name: Jane
	* Last Name: Doe
	* Username: Jane.Doe@bluebrand.com
	* Primary Email: Jane.Doe@bluebrand.com
	* Password: set by admin
	* Password: provide value
	* [Unchecked] User must change password on first login 
	<br/>
	<img src="Documentation/Images/Person-002.png" alt="Add Person"/>
	<br/>
	Go to Directory -> People. Now, you should see both test accounts.
	<br/>
	<img src="Documentation/Images/Person-003.png" alt="Add Person"/>
	<br/>

## Step 5. Create Groups ##
Its easier to manage users and applications by creating groups. Now, we will create two brand groups and add test accounts to those groups. 

Go to **Directory → Groups** 

### 5.1 Add GreenBrand Group ###
Create a group for Green Brand users.

- Click on **Add Group**
	* Name: GreenBrand Group
	* Description: Users belong to Green Brand
	<br/>
	<img src="Documentation/Images/Groups-001.png" alt="Add Person"/>
	<br/>
- Assign John.Doe@GreenBrand.com to GreenBrand Group
	<br/>
	<img src="Documentation/Images/Groups-002.png" alt="Add Person"/>
	<br/>
 

### 5.2 Add BlueBrand Group ###
Create a group for Blue Brand users.

- Click on **Add Group**
	* Name: BlueBrand Group
	* Description: Users belong to Blue Brand
	<br/>
	<img src="Documentation/Images/Groups-003.png" alt="Add Person"/>
	<br/>
- Assign Jane.Doe@BlueBrand.com to BlueBrand Group
	<br/>
	<img src="Documentation/Images/Groups-004.png" alt="Add Person"/>
	<br/>
- Go to Directory -> Groups, you should be able to see both groups (with one user member)
	<br/>
	<img src="Documentation/Images/Groups-005.png" alt="Add Person"/>
	<br/>

## Step 6. Add OpenID Connect and SAML 2.0 Applications ##
Okta allows you to configure OpenID Connect or SAML2 Web applications. 

Go to **Applications → Applications**


### 6.1 Add OpenID Connect Branded Application ###

- Provide Application Name and Logo

	* Application Name: SAML2 Custom Login Page OIDC Client
	* Application Logo: Optional

	* Provide Login Redirect URIs: For every SAML 2 app that want to use branded login page,  we must configure redirect URL for that SAML app that will reissue SAML2 AuthN request. In response, Okta will send SAML response.
		* For Example: Green Brand Application SingIn Link
		https://oktane2018saml2.azurewebsites.net/SignIn/Link?Brand=GREEN
		* For Example: Blue Brand Application SingIn Link
		https://oktane2018saml2.azurewebsites.net/SignIn/Link?Brand=BLUE

# E. Configure, Deploy and Run Web Applications<a id="sec-5" name="sec-5"></a>

Now, we will update/review configuration settings for each project based on our Okta's Sandbox settings. It will give us better understanding of configuring Multi-branded application against single Okta Org. After that we should be able to publish/run on Microsoft Azure or run projects locally.

1. **OktaLogin**: First we will update configuration settings for OktaLogin project and run it locally or publish on Microsoft Azure.

	* **Note:** The key take away is that Relay state that is posted to the Login page will be returned in the response as the redirect URL. After authentication, the Okta session cookie is set there by allowing single sign-on between applications. 
	* Update **appSettings** section in **Web.config**
		* ida:Authority: Provide Okta's Preview Sandbox e.g. e.g. https://dev-######.oktapreview.com
		<br/>
		<img src="Documentation/Images/E-Login-001.png" alt="Add Application"/>
		<br/>
	* Review **SignInController.cs** 
		* Read Okta RelayState parameter (Form POST parameter)
		* Read Brand Code from URL hostname or from query string parameter
		<br/>
		<img src="Documentation/Images/E-Login-002A.png" alt="Add Application"/>
		<br/>
	* Review **login_util.js** under **Scripts**
		* Check how values for redirectUrl and orgUrl are provided to Okta's Sign-In widget
		<br/>
		<img src="Documentation/Images/E-Login-002B.png" alt="Add Application"/>
		<br/> 
	* [Optional] **Publish Okta Login on Microsoft Azure**	
		* You can publish Okta Login project on Azure and host login pages on branded domains e.g. https://demo.login.greenbrand.com and https://demo.login.bluebrand.com
		<br/>
		<img src="Documentation/Images/E-Login-003.png" alt="Add Application"/>
		<br/>
	* [optional] ** Custom Domains configuration in Microsoft Azure**
		* You can configure custom domains for login page application in Microsoft Azure
		<br/>
		<img src="Documentation/Images/customdomain.png" alt="Add Application"/>
		<br/> 
	* <b>Note</b>:This application must be running (either in Azure or locally) before you test OpenID Client or SAML 2.0 Client
	<br/>

2. **Okta.Clients.OpenIdConnect**: Lets update/review configuration settings for OpenID Connect client application.
	* Update **appSettings** section in **Web.config**
		* ida:Authority: Provide Okta's Preview Sandbox environment e.g. https://dev-######.oktapreview.com
		* ida:AuthorizationServer: Provide Custom Authorization server e.g. https://dev-######.oktapreview.com/oauth2/auseqf1tfe6bvxxxxxxx
		* ida:ClientId: Provide Client ID for this application
		* ida:ClientSecret: Provide Client secret for this application
		* ida:RedirectUri: Provide Redirect URL after user authentication e.g. https://hostname.com/
		* idp:BlueBrand: Provide Identity Provider (IdP) value for Blue brand
		* idp:GreenBrand: Provide Identity Provider (IdP) value for Green brand
		<br/>
		<img src="Documentation/Images/E-001.png" alt="Add Application"/>
		<br/>
	* Review **IdentityProviderManagement.cs** utility class 
		* This purpose of this utility class is to determine application brand based on hostname or brand query string parameter.
		* If application is hosted on branded domain names e.g. app1.greenbrand.com and app1.bluebrand.com then this class can dynamically determine brand based on hostname.
		* If application is not hosted on branded domain names then brand can be passed as query string parameter e.g. app1.azurewebsites.net?brand=green or app1.azurewebsites.net?brand=blue
		<br/>
		<img src="Documentation/Images/E-001B.png" alt="Add Application"/>
		<br/>		
	* Review OpenID Connect Notification handler defined in **Startup.Auth.cs** under **App_Start**
		 * Review OnRedirectToIdentityProvider Notfication handler. We have to switch IdP value based on selected brand. Normally, brand will be determined based on hostname of application. For Example: app1.greenbrand.com means brand is green then we have to pass green brand IdP value to Okta's authorization server
		 <br/>
		 <img src="Documentation/Images/E-002.png" alt="Add Application"/>
		 <br/>
	* Make sure OktaLogin project is running
	* Run OpenID Connect client application for Okta Brand
	* Run OpenID Connect client application for Blue Brand
		* Start application
			<br/>
		 	<img src="Documentation/Images/Oidc-Blue-001.png" alt="Oidc"/>
		 	<br/>
		* Select Blue brand and click Sign-In button. You will see login page for blue brand.
			<br/>
		 	<img src="Documentation/Images/Oidc-Blue-002.png" alt="Oidc"/>
		 	<br/>
		* Enter credentials for test account e.g. john.doe@bluebrand.com and login. You will see user profile page.
		* Sign-out
	* Run OpenID Connect client application for Green Brand

3. **Okta.Clients.SAML2**: 
TODO - Run and Test Web Applications
App Settings - Web.Config for each project
OIDC - Notification handler for Startup file 
Normally, OIDC will determine brand from hostname. For this demo, we will use Id 
SAML2: Startup - SecurityIdentityProvider
Sections - for WebConfig
2 Apps - Unprotected, Login page and User profile page (for each)
Azure - deployment
